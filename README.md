## Task
- I needed a **text reader** because i'm lazy and i love to hear **AUDIOBOOKS** (now you know why i named it as **LazyREADER** 😉)
- All available text readers have **words limits** on it and they sell the Premium Subcription to remove words limit. 
- Even after getting Premium Subcription they don't let you to do **customize** the App according to yourself. 
So that's why i decided to make a **Text Reading Website** by myself. And here i'm!! 😁
- It's open so that you guys can also **folk** it and use it as you want ❤❤.
