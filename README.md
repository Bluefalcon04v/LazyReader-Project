## Task
- I needed a text reader cause i'm lazy and i don't want to read BOOKS or Pdf by myself. (now you know why i named it as *LazyREADER*).
- All available text readers have *words limits* on it and they sell the Premium Subcription to remove that word limit. 
- even after getting Premium Subcription they don't let us customize the Reader according to us. 
So that's why i decided to make a READING website by myself. And here we are!! 😁
