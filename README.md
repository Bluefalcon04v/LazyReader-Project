## Task
- I needed a text reader cause i'm lazy and i love to hear **AUDIOBOOKS** (now you know why i named it as *LazyREADER*).
- All available text readers have **words limits** on it and they sell the Premium Subcription to remove word limits. 
- Even after getting Premium Subcription they don't let you to do **customize** the App according to your liking. 
So that's why i decided to make a **READING website** by myself. And here i'm are!! 😁
- It's open so that you guys can also **folk** it and use it as you want ❤❤.
